Time will heal all wounds...
But I don't regret, I give it all what I can, 
All my efforts , I tried my best, its just that it doesn't meant for me.

Everything changes and moves forward.
Thats how the world turns around,

Its more important to be neutral. Striving not to strive. 
There's nothing more important than the loves of those 
by your side.

Remember this, and never let it just pass by without taking a moment to embrace those beautiful time. 
Never take it for granted and let it go and wasted those beautiful moments.Remember life is now. Its happening now.

At times in life, roads become muddy and filthy and full of muds. Figuring out that needs to be done
